Plain English approach to solving this problem:

This problem is solved by taking a string, stripping it of any irrelevant characters (non-alphanumeric as specified by the problem), converting the rest of the characters to the same standard so they can be compared easily (making it case insensitive, ignoring any spaces that might interfere with the reversal), and then finally using the result to compare if the inverse of the string is the same exact string.
